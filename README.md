SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.
In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data
Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilize machine
learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing
them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By
leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their
advertising strategies and maximize sales potential. Let's embark on
the journey of sales prediction using machine learning in Python.
